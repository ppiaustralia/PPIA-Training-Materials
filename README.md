- [Don't ask to ask, just ask](https://dontasktoask.com/)
- You don't have to master everything, most of this stuff here are for Web Development
- if you're interested in somewhere else, then try it and give it a go for a couple of months (and projects)
- Find you goal (or project), then divide it into smaller parts and spend a few hours in it everyday as your side projects
