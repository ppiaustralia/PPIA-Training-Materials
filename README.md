<h2>Assumption<a name="assume"></a></h2>

It is important that this needs to be address. Learning everything in this repo will absolutely not make you a brilliant programmer out of nowhere. This are mostly notes, just because you have this and went through all of this , doesn't mean you'll suddenly become a [Unicorn](https://easternpeak.com/blog/3-in-1-developer-a-jack-of-all-trades-or-a-unicorn/). The only way possible to be an expert in a certain field is to work on a project, whether it is small or big. Here are some example that you can use:

- Build a simple login and logout website (webdev)
- Make a simple CRUD website (full stack)
- Make a Calculator (logic)
- Use your assignment but change the language
- Learn Data Structures & Algorithms

It is important to address the fact that almost all of the materials are only meant for Web Development(for now)

`The next step of this project is to make it open source and have as many people contributing to this.`
To make things simpler, `Github Actions` have been created for this repository, to help out with making future updates.

<h2>Advices<a name="advice"></a></h2>

- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmqok1dJrVs" target="_blank">Watch: The Art of Finishing Project</a>
- <a href="https://dontasktoask.com/" target="_blank">Don't ask to ask, just ask</a>
- You don't have to master everything, most of this stuff here are for Web Development
- if you're interested in somewhere else, then try it and give it a go for a couple of months (and projects)
- Find you goal (or project), then divide it into smaller parts and spend a few hours in it everyday as your side projects
