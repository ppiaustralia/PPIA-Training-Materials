## 1. Introduction: Stages of Project Planning

In project planning, there are 5 stages:

1.  **Conception and Initiation** <br>
    The project initiation phase is the first stage of turning an abstract idea into a meaningful goal. In this stage, you need to develop a business case and define the project on a broad level. In order to do that, you have to determine the need for the project and create a project charter.

    The project charter is an important document consisting of details like the project constraints, goals, appointment of the project manager, budget, expected timeline, etc.

    Once you have the project goals and project scope, identify key project stakeholders–the people who are to be involved in the project. Create a stakeholder register with the roles, designation, communication requirements, and influence.

2.  **Planning** <br>
    This phase is key to successful project management and focuses on developing a roadmap that everyone will follow. This phase typically begins with setting goals. Two of the more popular methods for setting goals are S.M.A.R.T. and CLEAR.

    **S.M.A.R.T.** Goals – This method helps ensure that the goals have been thoroughly vetted. It also provides a way to clearly understand the implications of the goal-setting process.

    <details>
    Specific – To set specific goals, answer the following questions: who, what, where, when, which, and why.<br>
    Measurable – Create criteria that you can use to measure the success of a goal.<br>
    Attainable – Identify the most important goals and what it will take to achieve them.<br>
    Realistic – You should be willing and able to work toward a particular goal.<br>
    Timely – Create a timeframe to achieve the goal.
    </details>

    **C.L.E.A.R.** Goals – A newer method for setting goals that takes into consideration the environment of today’s fast-paced businesses.

    <details>
    Collaborative – The goal should encourage employees to work together.<br>
    Limited – They should be limited in scope and time to keep it manageable.<br>
    Emotional – Goals should tap into the passion of employees and be something they can form an emotional connection to. This can optimize the quality of work.<br>
    Appreciable – Break larger goals into smaller tasks that can be quickly achieved.<br>
    Refinable – As new situations arise, be flexible and refine goals as needed.
    </details>

3.  **Execution** <br>
    This is the phase where deliverables are developed and completed. This often feels like the meat of the project since a lot is happening during this time, like status reports and meetings, development updates, and performance reports. A “kick-off” meeting usually marks the start of the Project Execution phase where the teams involved are informed of their responsibilities.

    Tasks completed during the Execution Phase include:

    <details>
    Develop team<br>
    Assign resources<br>
    Execute project management plans<br>
    Procurement management if needed<br>
    PM directs and manages project execution<br>
    Set up tracking systems<br>
    Task assignments are executed<br>
    Status meetings<br>
    Update project schedule<br>
    Modify project plans as needed
    </details>

    While the project monitoring phase has a different set of requirements, these two phases often occur simultaneously.

4.  **Project Monitoring and Controlling** <br>
    The project monitoring and controlling phase run simultaneously with project execution, thereby ensuring that objectives and project deliverables are met.

    As a project manager, you can make sure that no one deviates from the original plan by establishing Critical Success Factors (CSF) and Key Performance Indicators (KPI).

    During the monitoring phase of project management, the manager is also responsible for quantitatively tracking the effort and cost during the process. This tracking not only ensures that the project remains within the budget but also is important for future projects

5.  **Project Close** <br>
    This is the final phase of the project management process. The project closure stage indicates the end of the project after the final delivery. Most teams hold a reflection meeting after the completion of the project in order to contemplate their successes and failures during the project.

## 2. How to determine Stakeholders?

### **What is Stakeholders**<br>

A stakeholder is a party that has an interest in a company and can either affect or be affected by the business. The primary stakeholders in a typical corporation are its investors, employees, customers, and suppliers.

### **Types of Stakeholders**

There are three types of stakeholders:

- **Primary**, <br>
  Primary Stakeholders are the type of stakeholders that are directly involve in the success of the project. For example: **Owner**
- **Secondary**, <br>
  Secondary Stakeholders are the type of stakeholders that are are not involve directly to the success of the project. For example: **Sponsors**
- **and Not a Stakeholders**<br>
  Groups that does not fall within Primary or Secondary.

## 3. Risk Assessment Matrix

<br>

### Risk Analysis using 4x4 Risk Assessment Matrix <br>

By using Risk Assessment Matrix, it will be easy to identify the risks of the problems.
Please refer to the example docs

### Constraints

Constraints are limitations and risks that will effect the project.
Common constraints are as follow:

- Time or Schedule
- Scope
- Cost or Budget
- Resources
- Quality
- Benefits
- Risk

---

## 4. Scope Items

<br>
Scope refers to the deliverables and requirements of a project. In project management, scope items are identified into two parts: <br>

- **In-Scope Items** <br>
  This are the lists of items that needs to be delivered within the scope of the project. <br>
- **Out-Scope Items** <br>
  This are the lists of the items that will not be delivered within this scope or this project

---

## 5. Key Success Criteria

<br>
Identify project success criteria and determine what is a successful project.

### Customer Service KPI

<br>
Similarly, identify what a customer service KPI is

---

## 6. Project Timeline (using Gantt Chart)

<br>
Project timeline in Project Management usually uses Gantt Chart.

A Gantt chart, commonly used in project management, is one of the most popular and useful ways of showing activities (tasks or events) displayed against time.

- On the left of the chart is a list of the activities,
- Along the Top is a suitable time scale.
- Each activity is represented by a bar;
- The position and length of the bar reflects the start date, duration and end date of the activity

### Waterfall vs Agile

<br>
Agile makes sense where a project is based on incremental progress, complex deliverables or consists of multiple, not always sequential timelines. Projects that require cohesive and collaborative but cross-functional teams to deliver will need to take an Agile approach
<br><br>
Waterfall is usually more suited to less complex projects or those that have well defined requirements, processes and roles for team members. Single delivery timeframes with lots of detail and an expectation that very little is likely to change along the way are ideal. Waterfall also works well when the client is not required to be heavily involved beyond the initial brief and final delivery.
